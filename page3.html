    <h1>My Future Goals</h1>
    
    <p>
        One of my biggest goals is to graduate from college with a degree in computer science. I am passionate about technology and programming, and I want to build a career in software development. I plan to work hard in all my classes and maintain good grades throughout my college years. After graduation, I hope to land a job at a technology company where I can create innovative software solutions. I believe that with dedication and continuous learning, I can achieve this goal and make a positive impact in the tech industry.

        Another important goal I have is to travel the world and experience different cultures. I want to visit at least twenty different countries before I turn thirty years old. Traveling will help me learn about different ways of life and broaden my perspective on the world. I am particularly interested in visiting places in Europe and Asia to see historical landmarks and taste local cuisines. I plan to save money from my future job to make these travel dreams a reality. Traveling will not only be fun but also educational and personally enriching.
